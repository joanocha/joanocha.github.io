        I am an evolutionary biologist at the department of Integrative Biology at UC Berkeley, working with <a href="http://www.sudmantlab.org/index.html">Peter Sudmant</a>. I received my PhD in Biodiversity, Genetics and Evolution having been advised by Raquel Godinho at the University of Porto, and Rasmus Nielsen at UC Berkeley.

        My <a href="https://joanocha.github.io/projects/">research</a> addresses pressing fundamental questions in environmental change biology. In a nutshell: I study the genetic mechanisms behind how species adapt and evolve in response to changing environmental conditions, allowing scientists to understand the link between evolutionary change and the environment. When I am not doing science, I enjoy being in close contact with nature and sharing all the amazing wonders our planet has to offer with the people I love.
