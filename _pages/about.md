    <p>
        I am an evolutionary biologist and postdoctoral researcher at the department of Integrative Biology at UC Berkeley, working with <a href="http://www.sudmantlab.org/index.html">Peter Sudmant</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I received my PhD in Biodiversity, Genetics and Evolution having been advised by Raquel Godinho at the University of Porto, and Rasmus Nielsen at UC Berkeley.

    <p>
        When I am not doing <a href="https://joanocha.github.io/projects/">research</a>, I enjoy being in close contact with nature and sharing all the amazing wonders our planet has to offer with the people I love. I was born in Portugal, and I speak fluently portuguese, english, spanish and a bit of french. Feel free to contact me in any of these languages.
