I am also interested in the historical events and paleoclimatic and/or geomorphological processes that shaped the evolutionary histories of different mammalian species, particularly the way these factors have affected genetic variation, past population dynamics and population structure in species from all of the major African biomes. For comprehensive sampling of natural populations and range-wide population genomics analyses, we have relied on large museum collections and scientific expeditions to the field.
