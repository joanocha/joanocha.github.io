Though single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets can be used to dissect the genomic basis of fitness-relevant traits, this is only one component of adaptive genetic variation. Structural rearrangements (aka structural variation or SVs), for instance, can impact gene function and the content and structure of chromosomes, thus representing remarkable sources of functional genomic variation. However, our understanding of the role of structural rearrangements within a genome on species diversification and adaptation to environmental change is still challenged by most sequencing methods. During my postdoctoral research I have been using novel sequencing and computational techniques to study structural variation at a population scale.
