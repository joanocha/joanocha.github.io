Though single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets can be used to dissect the genomic basis of fitness-relevant traits, this is only one component of adaptive genetic variation. Structural rearrangements (structural variation or SVs), for instance, can impact gene function and the content and structure of chromosomes, thus representing remarkable sources of functional genomic variation. However, our understanding of the role of structural rearrangements within a genome on species diversification and adaptation to environmental change is still challenged by most sequencing methods. During my postdoctoral research I have been using novel sequencing and computational techniques to study structural variation at a population scale.

When humans domesticated grains some 12,000 years ago, natural selection began to favor genomes with extra genes encoding for the enzyme amylase, which converts starch to sugar. These extra genes slipped into the same region of the genome where the three amylase genes originally sat (top set of arrows), though some became reversed (lower sets of arrows). Multiple copies of amylase genes presumably allowed agrarian societies to more efficiently extract energy from a diet high in carbohydrates.
