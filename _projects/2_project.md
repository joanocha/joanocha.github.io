Though single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets can be used to dissect the genomic basis of fitness-relevant traits, this is only one component of adaptive genetic variation, and our understanding of the role of large structural rearrangements within a genome on species diversification and adaptation to environmental change is still challenged by most sequencing methods. 

Structural rearrangements can impact gene function and the content and structure of chromosomes, thus representing remarkable sources of functional genomic variation. During my postdoctoral research I will be using novel sequencing and computational techniques to study chromosome structural evolution in foxes and apes.
