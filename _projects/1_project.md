Deserts are bellwethers for climate change and are outstanding natural laboratories to study biological adaptation. The goal of my PhD research was to advance our general understanding of the genetic basis and evolutionary mechanisms underlying mammalian adaptation to extreme arid/hyper-arid environments. To address this I have been using a set of integrative approaches to study the demographic and adaptive history of North-African foxes.
