Deserts are bellwethers for climate change and are outstanding natural laboratories to study biological adaptation. Since the start of my PhD research I seek to advance our general understanding of the genetic basis and evolutionary mechanisms underlying mammalian adaptation to extreme arid/hyper-arid environments. To address this I have been using a set of integrative approaches to study the demographic and adaptive history of North-African foxes and other desert-dwelling species.
